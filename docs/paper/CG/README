This folder contains scripts used to generate data for the paper

  * Efficient spectral-Galerkin methods for second-order equations using different Chebyshev bases

Most of the results are computed with shenfun using scripts

  * CGpaper_dirichlet.py
  * CGpaper_neumann.py

The generalised Chebyshev-Tau results are computed with dedalus using scripts

  * GT_dirichlet.py
  * GT_neumann.py

Please note that shenfun and dedalus have conflicting dependencies. For
this reason the two require separate environments to run. The shenfun
environment can be generated using

  >>> conda env create -f shenfunenv.yml

The dedalus environment is slightly more complicated, because the results
have been computed with a nonstandard branch. The dedalus environment can be
created by executing the bash script 'install_dedalus.sh'

  >>> bash install_dedalus.sh
