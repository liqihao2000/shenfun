Welcome to shenfun's documentation!
===================================

Shenfun is a high performance computing platform for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by the spectral Galerkin method.
The user interface to shenfun is very similar to `FEniCS`_,
but applications are limited to multidimensional tensor product grids,
using either Cartesian or curvilinear grids (polar/cylindrical/spherical).
The code is parallelized with MPI through the `mpi4py-fft`_ package.

Shenfun enables fast development of efficient and accurate PDE solvers
(spectral order and accuracy), in the comfortable high-level Python
language. The spectral accuracy is ensured by using high-order
*global* orthogonal basis functions (Fourier, Legendre, Chebyshev, Laguerre and Hermite),
as opposed to finite element codes that are using low-order
*local* basis functions. Efficiency is ensured through vectorization
(`Numpy`_), parallelization (`mpi4py`_) and by moving critical routines to
`Cython`_ or `Numba`_. Shenfun has been used to run turbulence simulations (Direct
Numerical Simulations) on thousands of processors on high-performance
supercomputers, see the `spectralDNS`_ repository.
